## About Me

I fell in love with computers during my 8th grade engineering class where I learned that I could do anything from making my own video game to telling a Lego robot what to do. A few years passed and my love for computers became a passion for all things programming. I fueled this passion by participating in competitive programming competitions and by puzzling out the problems on projecteuler.net (which I highly recommend for all my math and algorithm nerds out there!).

During high school I got the crazy opportunity to work briefly as a Software Engineer Intern at Lockheed Martin after participating in their programming contest (which came complete with a tour of their jet plane assembly line!). Even though it was an hour commute both ways every day, I loved every second of it. Working there and putting my skills into practice developing a web based application cemented my desire to make programming my career.

Now as a student at Brigham Young University I get to study my dream field while working as a Software Engineering Research Assistant for the Family History Technology Lab. I manage web infrastructure on AWS using CI/CD and Terraform IAC. Other parts of my job involve configuring DNS for our websites and developing and debugging JavaScript code on both the frontend using Angular as well as the backend using Node.js.
